# Code Demos
These demos provide a range of basic functionality for your LED matrix. Ranging from simply turning on LEDs, to an FFT-based music visualizer and 
displaying simple animations. Currently all of these demos are written 
using the Arduion IDE. To program your board you will therefor need to 
download a few things.  

## Requirements
- [Arduino IDE](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2/tutorials/getting-started/ide-v2-downloading-and-installing/)
- [ESP32 Board support package](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html)
- [Arduino FFT library](https://github.com/kosme/arduinoFFT)
- [Adafruit NeoPixel library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel)

*For the multi mode example, you will also need the [Arduino Audio Tools library](https://github.com/pschatzmann/arduino-audio-tools) which cannot be installed through the Arduino Library manager, but rather through git or by downloading the zip*
